# Mouth Open Detector (MOD)
## Introduction
This repository contains the code for the research article **"[Mouth Detector with Combination Between LipNet and PyImageSearch](https://wjarr.com/content/mouth-detector-combination-between-lipnet-and-pyimagesearch)"**, published in the World Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews (WJARR), Volume 22, Issue 3, 2024. The study explores the innovative integration of LipNet and PyImageSearch to develop a robust mouth detection system using deep learning and computer vision, aimed at enhancing the accuracy and reliability of automatic lip reading systems.

## Tools and Libraries

- python
- scipy
- imutils
- numpy
- dlib
