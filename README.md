# Mouth Open Detector (MOD)

This repository contains the code for the research article **"[Mouth Detector with Combination Between LipNet and PyImageSearch]([url](https://wjarr.com/content/mouth-detector-combination-between-lipnet-and-pyimagesearch))"**, published in the World Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews (WJARR), Volume 22, Issue 3, 2024. The study explores the innovative integration of LipNet and PyImageSearch to develop a robust mouth detection system using deep learning and computer vision, aimed at enhancing the accuracy and reliability of automatic lip reading systems.

## Abstract

In the digital age, the authenticity and integrity of multimedia content have become increasingly critical, especially in contexts involving high-profile political figures like former President Donald Trump. The proliferation of manipulated and deepfake videos poses significant threats to public discourse and trust. This project addresses these challenges by developing a lip-reading system using PyImageSearch and Python TensorFlow to verify and validate spoken content in videos. By leveraging advanced computer vision techniques and machine learning models, the system aims to analyze and interpret lip movements accurately, ensuring the correspondence between the spoken words and the audio track. This tool can be instrumental in detecting inconsistencies and potential manipulations in videos, thereby enhancing the reliability of digital content. The ultimate goal is to provide a robust solution that can be utilized by media organizations, fact-checkers, and the general public to maintain the integrity of political communications in the digital realm.
